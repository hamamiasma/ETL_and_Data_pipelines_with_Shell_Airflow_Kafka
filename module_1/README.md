  # ETL Workflows as Data Pipelines

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a well-structured process designed to meet technical and end-user requirements. It involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a destination database or data warehouse.

## Introduction

ETL workflows are designed to collect, process, and store data efficiently. Traditionally, the overall accuracy of ETL workflows has been prioritized over speed, although efficiency remains important to minimize resource costs.

To enhance efficiency, data is fed through a data pipeline in smaller packets. While one packet is extracted, an earlier packet is transformed, and another is loaded. This concurrent processing maintains a continuous flow, preventing bottlenecks. In case of slow tasks, parallel processing can be applied to optimize performance.

## ETL Processing Types

ETL pipelines typically operate in **batch processing** mode, scheduled periodically or triggered by events. The main types are:

1. **Periodic (Scheduled):** Data is processed at fixed intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
2. **Event-triggered:** Data processing is initiated based on specific events (e.g., size thresholds or security alerts).
3. **On-demand:** Data is processed when requested, such as in streaming services (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).

## Staging Areas

Staging Areas act as temporary storage zones where raw data is held before transformation and loading. These areas help manage change detection, updates, and data transformations to ensure consistency before moving to OLAP systems.

**Benefits:**

* Minimize impact on source systems.
* Allow for data cleansing and normalization.
* Simplify update and change detection processes.

# ETL as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)

##  What is a DAG?

A **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** is a data structure composed of **nodes (tasks)** and **directed edges (dependencies)** — with **no loops or cycles**.

- **Directed:** Each step has a clear direction; the data flows from one task to another.
- **Acyclic:** No task can indirectly lead back to itself (no circular paths).
- **Graph:** A network-like structure where tasks are connected logically.

##  Why Represent ETL as a DAG?

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often consist of many sequential steps with dependencies.  
Using a DAG to represent an ETL pipeline helps make the process:

- **Logical**: Clear order of operations
- **Modular**: Each step is reusable and testable
- **Repeatable**: Easy to rerun parts of the pipeline

## Example: ETL as a DAG

Let’s imagine a simple ETL pipeline: Extract → Clean → Normalize → Join → Load


### DAG Representation:

```text
[Extract]
     ↓
  [Clean]
     ↓
[Normalize]    [Other Data Extract]
       ↓          ↓
     [Join] ←─────
       ↓
     [Load]
```

# Explanation:

- **Extract**: Pulls data from a source system.
- **Clean**: Removes duplicates, missing values, or corrupt records.
- **Normalize**: Unifies formats (e.g., currency, date formats).
- **Other Data Extract**: Retrieves additional data (e.g., customer details).
- **Join**: Merges multiple data sources.
- **Load**: Loads the final transformed data into a data warehouse or storage system.

## Popular ETL Tools

A list of well-known ETL tools:

1. **Talend Open Studio** - Open-source, supports Big Data and Data Warehousing with drag-and-drop interfaces.
2. **AWS Glue** - Cloud-based ETL service that automates schema detection and job scheduling.
3. **IBM InfoSphere DataStage** - Enterprise-grade tool with parallel processing and graphical design.
4. **Alteryx** - Self-service data analytics platform with a user-friendly interface.
5. **Apache Airflow** - Workflow orchestration tool that defines workflows as code (DAGs).
6. **Pandas (Python Library)** - Lightweight data processing, ideal for prototyping and analysis.

## Real-Time ETL

Real-Time ETL enables processing data as it arrives, unlike traditional batch processing. Technologies like **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Flink**, and **Apache Spark Streaming** are used to achieve low-latency data processing.

**Use Case:** Stock trading platforms where price updates are reflected instantaneously.

## OLTP vs. OLAP

| Characteristic | OLTP                     | OLAP                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Purpose        | Transactional processing | Analytical processing    |
| Data Size      | Small to Medium          | Large (historical data)  |
| Operations     | Insert, Update, Delete   | Complex Queries          |
| Normalization  | High                     | Low                      |
| Speed          | High for transactions    | High for read operations |

## Examples

* **Batch Processing:** Daily aggregation of sales data from various POS systems into a central data warehouse.
* **Event-Triggered Processing:** Initiating ETL jobs when IoT sensors detect anomalies.
* **Real-Time Processing:** Streaming user interactions on a live video platform.
